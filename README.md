# customer-Segmentation
Unsupervised Learning
In this project I used a Mall database from kaggle, to create a model for customer-Segmentation, the data contains 5 variables (Gender, Id, Age, AnnualIncome, SpendingScore), where spending Score is a metric Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature

the main goal of this project is to divide customers into groups, to extract insights such as: Do we have any standards within the customers who spend the most on the market ?, Do we have any group standards that could be further explored?

and after analysing and creating the model i found 5 Major groups:

GROUP 0   	  
High Income
High Score
20-68 Years

GROUP 1
Average income
Average High Score
18-70 Years

GROUP 2
High Income
Average Low Score
18-60 Years

GROUP 3
Low Income
High Score
18-35 Years

GROUP 4
Low Income
Average Low Score
20-68 Years

so after we separate customers into groups based on their characteristics, which groups could spend more? (1, 2, 4)
which groups are unlikely to spend more?(0, 3)
